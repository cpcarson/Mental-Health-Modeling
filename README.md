# Modeling Mental Health   

### Background  
This project was completed as part of General Assembly's coursework, and was the result of a one-day "hackathon."  

### Problem Statement
The issue of diminished mental health is a multi-facited problem. This notebook aims to explore the possible correlation between substance use/abuse and the potential for depression and suicidal thoughts. All data was taken from the United States HHS National Survey on Drug Use and Health, taken in 2012. 

### Results  
The results supported the hypothesis that heavy drug use and dependency are correlated with higher likelihood of suicidality and poor mental health. The data showed that survey respondants with drug dependency were four times more likely to have experienced suicidality, and, furthermore, that the use of illicit pain relievers were the most highly correlated with diminished mental health.

### Further Exploration  
Because I was only able to spend about 6 hours on this project, it is in no way complete. It does, however, afford insight into potential high-risk populations that should be looked into more closely.
